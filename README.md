Reign - Reinforcement Learning
===============================

This project uses Reign.js to power a reinforcement learning visualization. A
circular agent moves around a grid world in search of positive terminal
states, and all of its actions are drawn to an HTML5 canvas.

To see this in action, check out http://turbomaze.github.io/reign/.
